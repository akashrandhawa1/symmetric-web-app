## Live Coaching System - Real-Time Strength Training Guidance

## Overview

The Live Coaching System provides **real-time, rep-by-rep feedback** during strength training sets, with a focus on the optimal 3-6 rep range for max strength gains.

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Real-time drop-down cues** as user performs each rep
‚úÖ **Zone-based guidance** (Warmup ‚Üí Goldilocks ‚Üí Approaching Limit ‚Üí Unproductive)
‚úÖ **End-of-set summary** with scientific reasoning
‚úÖ **Varied, non-repetitive messaging** to keep coaching fresh
‚úÖ **Visual feedback** with color-coded rep zones
‚úÖ **Clear strength/recovery explanations**

---

## Rep Zones & Coaching Strategy

### Zone 1: Warmup (Reps 0-2)
**Goal**: Building momentum into the set
**Cues**: Encouraging, neutral tone
**Examples**:
- "You're building up‚Äîlet's keep going."
- "Warming up nicely. Stay controlled."
- "Good start. Building momentum."

**Color**: üîµ Blue

---

### Zone 2: Goldilocks (Reps 3-6) ‚≠ê
**Goal**: Maximum strength stimulus
**Cues**: Enthusiastic, affirming
**Examples**:
- "Nice! You're right in the strength zone."
- "Perfect range‚Äîthis is where strength happens."
- "Rep 5‚Äîright in the sweet spot for gains."

**Scientific Tip**: "This 3-6 rep range recruits high-threshold motor units for max strength gains."

**Color**: ‚ú® Green

---

### Zone 3: Approaching Limit (Reps 7-8)
**Goal**: Warning about diminishing returns
**Cues**: Gentle warning, educational
**Examples**:
- "Heads up‚Äîapproaching the fatigue threshold."
- "Rep 7‚Äîyou're getting close to unproductive range."
- "Quality over quantity here. Consider stopping soon."

**Color**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow

---

### Zone 4: Unproductive (Reps 9+)
**Goal**: Clear guidance to stop
**Cues**: Direct warning with reasoning
**Examples**:
- "Heads up, you're going beyond the ideal range now."
- "Rep 9‚Äînow in fatigue territory. Stop when form breaks."
- "You've moved past the strength zone. Finish this rep and consider stopping."

**Scientific Tip**: "Beyond 8 reps at this weight, you're accumulating fatigue faster than strength stimulus."

**Color**: üõë Red

---

## End-of-Set Summaries

### Perfect Range (3-6 reps)
**Icon**: üéØ
**Feedback**: "Great set! You hit [X] reps right in the productive zone for strength."
**Guidance**: "Same weight next set‚Äîconsistency here builds a solid base."
**Science**: "Staying in this 3-6 rep range maximizes mechanical tension while minimizing metabolic fatigue."

---

### Too Few Reps (<3 reps)
**Icon**: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
**Feedback**: "Only [X] reps‚Äîyou've got more in the tank."
**Guidance**: "Push for at least 3-6 reps next set. Consider adding weight if this felt too easy."
**Science**: "Sub-3 rep sets are great for neural adaptation but need heavier loads to build strength effectively."

---

### Slightly Over (7-8 reps)
**Icon**: ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Feedback**: "Good effort‚Äî[X] reps total. You went slightly past the ideal 3-6 range."
**Guidance**: "Next set: stop around rep 5-6. You'll build the same strength with less fatigue."
**Science**: "Reps 7-8 start tipping the balance toward metabolic stress rather than pure strength stimulus."

---

### Way Over (9+ reps)
**Icon**: üõë
**Feedback**: "You went a bit over the ideal range with [X] reps. That's endurance work, not strength."
**Guidance**: "Let's dial it back next time‚Äîstop around rep 5-6 to keep this in the strength zone."
**Science**: "Beyond 8 reps, you're accumulating fatigue without additional strength stimulus. More isn't always better."

import { SetSummaryCard } from '@/components/coach/SetSummaryCard';
import { generateSetSummary, getRepZone } from '@/lib/coach/liveCoaching';

function WorkoutScreen() {
  const [currentRep, setCurrentRep] = useState(0);
  const [phase, setPhase] = useState<'executing' | 'summary'>('executing');

  const context = {
    current_rep: currentRep,
    target_rep_range: [3, 6],
    exercise_name: 'Barbell Squat',
    set_number: 1,
    user_training_age: 'intermediate',
  };

  if (phase === 'executing') {
    return (
      <>

        <RepCounter
          currentRep={currentRep}

        />
        <button onClick={() => setCurrentRep(prev => prev + 1)}>

        </button>
      </>
    );
  }

  const summary = generateSetSummary(currentRep, context);
  return <SetSummaryCard summary={summary} onContinue={startNextSet} />;

## API Integration (Gemini)

### Live Cue Generation

```typescript
import { buildLiveCuePrompt, LIVE_COACHING_SYSTEM_PROMPT } from '@/lib/coach/liveCoaching';

const prompt = buildLiveCuePrompt(context);
const cue = await gemini.generateContent({
  systemPrompt: LIVE_COACHING_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  prompt,
});
```

### Set Summary Generation

```typescript
import { buildSetSummaryPrompt } from '@/lib/coach/liveCoaching';

const prompt = buildSetSummaryPrompt(totalReps, context);
const summary = await gemini.generateContent({
  systemPrompt: LIVE_COACHING_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  prompt,
});
```

## Scientific Rationale

### Why 3-6 Reps for Strength?

1. **High Mechanical Tension**: Heavy loads create maximum tension on muscle fibers
2. **Optimal Motor Unit Recruitment**: Recruits high-threshold motor units (type IIx fibers)
3. **Minimal Metabolic Fatigue**: Keeps sets short enough to avoid excessive lactate buildup
4. **Neural Adaptations**: Teaches nervous system to produce max force efficiently
5. **Recovery-Friendly**: Less systemic fatigue than high-rep sets

### Why Avoid 8+ Reps at Heavy Loads?

1. **Diminishing Strength Returns**: Fatigue accumulates faster than strength stimulus
2. **Metabolic Stress Dominant**: Shifts from mechanical tension to metabolic work
3. **Recovery Cost**: Takes longer to bounce back from high-rep heavy sets
4. **Form Degradation**: More likely to break technique under fatigue
5. **Inefficient**: Could build same strength in fewer reps with less fatigue

## Testing the Demo

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `/live-coaching-demo` (or add route to your app):

```tsx
// In your router
import LiveCoachingDemo from '@/screens/LiveCoachingDemo';

<Route path="/live-coaching-demo" element={<LiveCoachingDemo />} />
```

### Demo Modes

1. **Auto-Play**: Simulates reps automatically (1 rep every 2s)
2. **Manual**: Tap "Rep Complete" button for each rep
3. **Early Stop**: End set anytime to see appropriate feedback

## Migration from Old System

### Removing Old voice.ts Logic

The old system in `voice.ts` had these issues:
- ‚ùå Post-set guidance only (no live feedback)
- ‚ùå Verbose, repetitive messaging
- ‚ùå No clear strength/recovery reasoning
- ‚ùå Decision-tree based (not AI-driven)

### New System Advantages

- ‚úÖ **Real-time feedback** during the set
- ‚úÖ **Zone-based coaching** aligned with 3-6 rep science
- ‚úÖ **Clear explanations** of strength/recovery impacts
- ‚úÖ **Gemini-powered** for natural, varied language
- ‚úÖ **Visual feedback** with color zones
- ‚úÖ **Educational** with optional science tips

### Deprecation Plan

1. **Phase 1** (Now): New live coaching available alongside old system
2. **Phase 2**: A/B test both systems with users
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate all users to new system
4. **Phase 4**: Remove `voice.ts` and old coaching logic

## Customization

### Adjust Target Rep Range

```typescript
// For different training goals
const strengthContext = { target_rep_range: [1, 5] };  // Max strength
const hypertrophyContext = { target_rep_range: [6, 12] };  // Muscle growth
const enduranceContext = { target_rep_range: [12, 20] };  // Endurance
```

### Customize Cue Timing

```tsx
// In LiveCoachingCue.tsx
const hideTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  setShowCue(false);
}, 3000); // Change duration here
```

### Add Custom Cues

```typescript
// In liveCoaching.ts
const customCues: LiveCue[] = [
  {
    zone: 'goldilocks',
    message: 'Your custom message here!',
    tone: 'encouraging',
  },
];
```
