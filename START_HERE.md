### "I still see the old one"

   npm run dev:logset
   ```

2. **Hard refresh browser**: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

3. **Check you're on the right URL**: `http://localhost:3000` for the demo

4. **Clear cache and restart**:
   ```bash
   # Kill dev server, then:
   npm run dev:logset
   ```

### "Panel doesn't appear"

- Wait 500ms - it auto-shows with delay
- Click "Log Set" button to manually open
- Check browser console for errors

### "Build errors"

Already tested - build is ✅ successful!
