# üéØ FOUND IT! The Real Culprit

## What Was Generating Those Messages

The messages you were seeing:
```
Hey Akash, you just crushed your workout! Your body's buzzing and ready for more.
Let's keep that momentum going...
```

Were coming from **`src/services.ts` line 1904** - a DIFFERENT Gemini function called `generateHomeHeroCopyWithGemini()`.

This function generates the home page hero text (line1 and line2) and was using a completely different prompt than the useHomeCoach hook!

## ‚úÖ What I Just Fixed

I replaced the OLD prompt at `src/services.ts:1903-1936` with the new warm, human coaching tone.

### Old Prompt (REMOVED):
```typescript
"You are Symmetric's strength coach. Generate friendly, concise home page hero copy..."
"Use natural, energetic, encouraging tone..."
"CONTEXT GUIDELINES: emphasize they're in a strong position, fresh, primed..."
```

### New Prompt (ADDED):
```typescript
"You are a warm, encouraging personal trainer who speaks like a human."
"NO phrases like 'body's buzzing', 'crushed a workout', 'systems firing', 'primed for more'"
"Use 'which means' to explain what readiness number means"
"Examples: 'Your readiness is at 85, which means you're fresh and ready to build strength.'"
```

## üß™ Test It Now

1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Go to** http://localhost:3001/
3. **Navigate to Home Screen**
4. **Check the message** - you should now see:

**‚úÖ NEW:**
```
Akash, your readiness is at 85, which means you're fresh and ready to build strength.
This is a good time to add a focused block. Stop when you approach readiness 50.
```

**NOT this:**
```
Hey Akash, you just crushed your workout! Your body's buzzing...
```

## üìç All Prompt Locations Updated

I've now updated ALL THREE locations where coach messages are generated:

1. ‚úÖ **`netlify/functions/home-coach.ts`** - Server-side Netlify function
2. ‚úÖ **`src/coach/useHomeCoach.ts`** - Client-side direct Gemini call
3. ‚úÖ **`src/services.ts:1904`** - Home hero copy generator (THE CULPRIT!)

All three now use the same warm, human tone with:
- "Your readiness is at [X], which means..."
- Clear explanations
- No "body's buzzing" or "crushed a workout" phrases
- Specific actionable guidance

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test locally** - verify you see the new messages
2. **If it works**, then deploy:
   ```bash
   git add src/services.ts src/coach/useHomeCoach.ts netlify/functions/home-coach.ts
   git commit -m "Fix: Replace all coach prompts with warm, human tone"
   git push
   ```

3. **After deploying**:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Hard refresh
   - Should see new messages on Netlify too!

## üîç Why This Was Hard to Find

The app has MULTIPLE places that call Gemini to generate coach messages:
- useHomeCoach hook (for suggestions)
- generateHomeHeroCopyWithGemini (for hero text on home screen) ‚Üê THIS WAS IT!
- Other coach functions for different contexts

Each had its own prompt, and I needed to update ALL of them!

Now they're all aligned with the new warm, human coaching style. üéâ
