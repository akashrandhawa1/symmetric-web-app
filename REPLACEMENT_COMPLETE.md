## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "I still see the old one"
1. **Hard refresh**: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. **Clear cache**: Browser settings → Clear cache
3. **Restart server**: Kill `npm run dev` and restart

### "Panel doesn't slide up"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you clicked the "Log this set" button
- Make sure `showSetLoggingPanel` state is working

### "Styling looks off"
- Your card is exactly as you designed it
- Panel backdrop is `z-40`, card is `z-50`
- All Tailwind classes preserved
