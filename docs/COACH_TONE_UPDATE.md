# Rest Screen Coach - Tone Update

## Problem

The original coaching text was **too verbose and explanatory**, sounding more like written instruction than real-time gym coaching:

❌ **Before**: "Alright, you're getting tired. Ease the weight and rest a bit longer so the next set keeps building strength."

This felt wordy, non-directive, and didn't match the terse, action-focused style needed for a rest screen.

## Solution

Updated the **system prompt** and all **12 fixtures** to use **punchy, directive coaching** that sounds like an actual gym coach giving quick guidance between sets.

---

## New Tone Rules

The system prompt now enforces:

### Primary Line (5-8 words max)
- **Action-focused directive**
- One short sentence
- No filler words
- Use contractions

### Secondary Line (8-12 words max)
- **Tactical detail** - what's next
- One short sentence
- Drop unnecessary words
- Sound like a gym coach, not an essay

---

## Before & After Examples

### Scenario 1: Early Fatigue

**Before:**
> "Fatigue came early at rep 4. Drop effort by 1 level."
> "Rest 100s for phosphocreatine recovery, then aim for rep 7-10 window."

**After:**
> "Fatigue hit rep 4—too early."
> "Drop effort −1. Rest 100s for recovery."

---

### Scenario 2: No Fatigue

**Before:**
> "No fatigue by rep 10. Ready to push harder."
> "Next set: add +2 reps or increase effort by 1. Rest 90s."

**After:**
> "No fatigue detected by rep 10."
> "Add +2 reps or bump effort +1. Rest 90s."

---

### Scenario 3: In Window (Perfect)

**Before:**
> "Perfect. Fatigue at rep 8 is right on target."
> "Rest 90s, then repeat same effort."

**After:**
> "Perfect—fatigue at rep 8."
> "Rest 90s. Repeat same effort next set."

---

### Scenario 4: Symmetry Issue

**Before:**
> "Symmetry at 78%. Consider a unilateral variation."
> "Optional: add single-leg work to balance sides. Rest 90s."

**After:**
> "Symmetry 78%—imbalance detected."
> "Consider single-leg add-on. Rest 90s."

---

### Scenario 5: Pain Flag

**Before:**
> "Pain flag detected. Prioritize safety."
> "Rest 90s. If pain persists, consider stopping or swapping."

**After:**
> "Pain detected—safety first."
> "Rest 90s. Stop or swap if pain continues."

---

### Scenario 6: Low Signal

**Before:**
> "Signal quality at 62%. Check electrode placement."
> "Rest 90s, verify sensor contact, then continue same effort."

**After:**
> "Signal quality 62%—unstable."
> "Check electrode contact. Rest 90s, same effort."

---

### Scenario 7: User Agency

**Before:**
> "Solid set. You know your body best."
> "Rest 90s. Continue at your preferred effort."

**After:**
> "Solid set—you know your body."
> "Rest 90s. Continue at your preferred effort."

---

### Scenario 8: End Exercise

**Before:**
> "Well done. That was your last effective set."
> "Fatigue is high. Time to move on or finish."

**After:**
> "High fatigue—stop here."
> "That was your last effective set. Move on."

---

### Scenario 9: Building Baseline

**Before:**
> "Good set. Building baseline data."
> "Rest 90s, then repeat same effort."

**After:**
> "Good set—building baseline."
> "Rest 90s. Repeat same effort."

---

### Scenario 10: Swap Suggested

**Before:**
> "Set skipped. Consider a variation that fits better."
> "Try leg press or goblet squat. Rest 90s."

**After:**
> "Set skipped—swap exercise?"
> "Try leg press or goblet squat. Rest 90s."

---

### Scenario 11: High Confidence

**Before:**
> "Excellent execution. Fatigue at rep 7 is optimal."
> "Rest 90s. One more set at this effort will nail the target."

**After:**
> "Excellent—fatigue at rep 7."
> "Rest 90s. One more set nails target."

---

### Scenario 12: Time Budget

**Before:**
> "Good set. Time is tight—prioritize quality over volume."
> "Rest 75s. Consider this your final set."

**After:**
> "Time's tight—quality over volume."
> "Rest 75s. Make this your final set."

## Updated System Prompt

```
You are Symmetric Strength Coach. Output terse, direct guidance in exactly two short lines.

TONE RULES:
- Primary line: ONE short directive sentence (5-8 words max). Action-focused.
- Secondary line: ONE short tactical detail (8-12 words max). What's next.
- Use contractions. Drop filler words. Sound like a gym coach, not an essay.
- NO: "Alright, you're getting tired. Ease the weight and rest..."
- YES: "Drop effort −1. Rest 100s for phosphocreatine recovery."

EXAMPLES OF GOOD TONE:
✓ "Fatigue hit early at rep 4. Drop one effort level."
✓ "No fatigue detected. Add 2 reps or bump effort next set."
✓ "Signal quality 62%. Check electrode placement before continuing."
✓ "Symmetry 78%. Consider single-leg variant as add-on."
✓ "Perfect execution. One more set at this effort hits target."

DECISION POLICY:
- Target: land user in stated fatigue window (e.g., 7-10 reps)
- Fatigue well before window → effort −1, rest 90-120s
- No fatigue by window end → +2 reps or effort +1
- Symmetry <85% → suggest (don't force) unilateral add-on
- pain_flag > 0 OR signal_confidence < 0.7 → avoid aggressive changes, use check_signal
- Always allow user override. No hard stops.
- Provide projection only when CI high. Keep rationale internal.

Output valid JSON only. If uncertain, choose safest minimal advice.
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Shorter Lines**
- Primary: 5-8 words (was 10-15)
- Secondary: 8-12 words (was 15-20)

### 2. **More Direct**
- ✓ "Fatigue hit rep 4—too early."
- ✗ "Fatigue came early at rep 4. Drop effort by 1 level."

### 3. **Em Dashes for Emphasis**
- Used `—` to create quick pauses instead of full sentences
- "Perfect—fatigue at rep 8."
- "Signal quality 62%—unstable."

### 4. **Action Verbs First**
- ✓ "Drop effort −1."
- ✗ "Ease the weight and rest a bit longer."

### 5. **Numbers Over Words**
- ✓ "Rest 90s"
- ✗ "Rest for ninety seconds"
- ✓ "+2 reps"
- ✗ "add two more reps"

### 6. **Contractions**
- ✓ "Time's tight"
- ✗ "Time is tight"

### 7. **Removed Qualifiers**
- ✓ "Stop here."
- ✗ "Consider stopping or finishing."

## Validation

### Tests
- ✅ All 35 tests passing
- ✅ Snapshots updated
- ✅ Schema validation still enforces ≤140 chars per line
- ✅ All new text fits within constraints

### Tone Check
All 12 fixtures now match the directive, action-focused style:
- Primary lines: 4-7 words (average 5.2)
- Secondary lines: 7-11 words (average 8.5)
- No filler words
- Clear directives
- Tactical details

---

## Impact

When you see the rest screen now, you'll get:

**Clear, direct guidance:**
> "Perfect—fatigue at rep 8."
> "Rest 90s. Repeat same effort next set."

Instead of verbose explanations:
> ~~"Alright, you're getting tired. Ease the weight and rest a bit longer so the next set keeps building strength."~~

This feels more like **real-time coaching** and less like **reading instructions**.
