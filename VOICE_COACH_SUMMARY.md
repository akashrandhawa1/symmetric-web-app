## 🎯 Key Features Delivered

### 1. State-Aware Coaching
- ✅ 10 app surfaces with distinct policies
- ✅ Silent by default on Home/Rest/Recovery
- ✅ Speaks only when `requiresChange=true` on quiet surfaces

### 2. Objective-Driven Responses
- ✅ 6 coaching objectives mapped to surfaces
- ✅ Each objective has tailored fallback cues
- ✅ Responses align with current workout phase

### 3. Topic Restrictions
- ✅ 9 coaching topics with surface-specific allowed lists
- ✅ Banned topics enforcement
- ✅ Quad-focused strength coaching only

### 4. Experience-Based Adaptation
- ✅ Novice: 22 words, basic topics
- ✅ Intermediate: 18 words, balanced topics
- ✅ Advanced: 14 words, terse cues

### 5. Concise Format (HOOK + WHY + ACTION)
- ✅ Word budget enforcement
- ✅ Automatic trimming (drops WHY clause first)
- ✅ ~6 seconds target duration

### 6. Safety & Guardrails
- ✅ Pain flag immediate override
- ✅ Topic validation (allowed/banned)
- ✅ Fallback cues for LLM failures
- ✅ Silence on error (vs bad advice)

---

## 🚀 Integration Points

### Main Entry Point
```typescript
import { generateStateAwareCoachResponse } from './coach/policy/integration';

const result = await generateStateAwareCoachResponse(ctx, userUtterance);
if (result.speak) {
  speak(result.text);
}
```

### Context Updates (4 Required)
1. **Set appSurface** when navigating screens
2. **Update lastSet** after each set with full performance data
3. **Call generateStateAwareCoachResponse** in voice handlers
4. **Set experienceBand** on app launch

See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed steps.

## 🧪 Test Results

All 15 tests passing:

- ✅ Silence behavior (4 tests)
  - Home surface with requiresChange=false → silent
  - Home surface with requiresChange=true → speaks
  - Rest overlay with requiresChange=false → silent
  - LLM silent flag honored

- ✅ Safety overrides (1 test)
  - Pain flag triggers immediate stop signal

- ✅ Topic restrictions (3 tests)
  - Banned topics rejected → fallback
  - Non-allowed topics rejected → fallback
  - Allowed topics accepted

- ✅ Word budget enforcement (3 tests)
  - Intermediate: ≤18 words
  - Novice: ≤22 words
  - Advanced: ≤14 words

- ✅ Fallback behavior (2 tests)
  - LLM failure → safe fallback cue
  - Malformed response → safe fallback cue

- ✅ Integration scenarios (2 tests)
  - Top set push scenario
  - Struggle with form cue

Run tests: `npm test src/coach/policy/__tests__/routeCoachReply.test.ts`

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Silent on Home/Recovery/Rest unless requiresChange=true | ✅ Pass | Tests verify silence + speak behavior |
| Working/Top Set responses ≤ word budget | ✅ Pass | Auto-trimming enforced, tested for all bands |
| All replies follow HOOK + WHY + ACTION | ✅ Pass | Format enforced, WHY dropped first when trimming |
| Safety wording triggers instantly on pain | ✅ Pass | Bypasses all policies, tested |
| Experience bands adjust verbosity + topics | ✅ Pass | 14/18/22 word budgets, topic lists differ |
| Code compiles, tests pass | ✅ Pass | 15/15 tests passing, no compilation errors in new files |
| Existing APIs unchanged | ✅ Pass | CoachContextBus extended (backwards compatible) |

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Voice Interaction
```typescript
// User on working set screen, asks: "How many reps should I do?"
const ctx = CoachContextBus.getSnapshot();
const result = await generateStateAwareCoachResponse(ctx, "How many reps?");
// result.text: "Hit 5 reps. Keep quality high. Stop at 5 clean reps."
```

### Example 2: Silent on Home
```typescript
// User on home screen, readiness=75, requiresChange=false
const result = await generateStateAwareCoachResponse(ctx, "What should I do?");
// result.speak === false (coach stays silent)
```

### Example 3: Safety Override
```typescript
// User reports pain during set
CoachContextBus.publishContext({ userFlags: { pain: true } });
const result = await generateStateAwareCoachResponse(ctx, "My knee hurts");
// result.text: "Stop the set. We don't push through pain. Skip squats..."
```

## 🎉 Benefits Over Previous System

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Verbosity | Variable, often long | Tight budget: 14-22 words |
| Context awareness | None | 10 surfaces, phase-aware |
| Topic control | None | Restricted by surface + band |
| Silence management | Always speaks | Silent by default on quiet surfaces |
| Structure | Free-form | HOOK + WHY + ACTION |
| Safety | Basic | Immediate pain override |
| Experience adaptation | None | Novice/Intermediate/Advanced |
| Testing | Minimal | 15 comprehensive tests |
| Objectives | Generic | 6 phase-specific objectives |
| Fallbacks | Hard-coded | Objective-aligned cues |

---

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Integrate** using 4-step checklist in [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
2. **Test** on one screen first (e.g., working_set)
3. **Monitor** `result.raw` to understand LLM behavior
4. **Tune** policies and heuristics based on user feedback
5. **Expand** to all surfaces incrementally
